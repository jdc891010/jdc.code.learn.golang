# Youtube lead learning, from Alex Mux [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mr_mux408)

I came across this channel and appreciated the content, and the way the information was explained and presented.
The notes and code sections I used here, was mostly copied from the channel's tutorials, and notes were added to make it easier to understand.
I added additional components to make it clearer for myself using my reference framework.
Full credit to Alex Mux for the original tutorials and content.
